This project aims to make the process of allocation more centralized and give every student a fair chance to opt for his aspiring subject. It will also help improve the process and make it more accurate as well as reliable. It will also avoid data redundancy and false data. The objective of this project is to manage data in a well-sorted and organized way. This will also decrease the amount of manual work and will indulge in more automated processing.

We have created this portal to help the administrator to gather all the data with a single click. Students can apply for this subject allocation using this portal within the specified deadline set by the administrator and will be able to view their results after allocation by the admin. Admin has the power to change the capacity of each course as well as open and close the registration anytime when he/she aspires to do so, at the same time the admin can view all the data input by the students and can alter or publish the data accordingly. The main spotlight of our project is the allocation algorithm. It is designed in such a way that there won't be any chance of malpractice. It also considers the late submissions(after the approval of the admin) and allocates the remaining vacant seats without replacing others the ones filled earlier.
